# Donations-ImproveAfrica

## Overview

Donations-ImproveAfrica is a project aimed at supporting 40 kindergarten students at Immanuel Vision School by raising funds to cover their school fees. Each child's school fees amount to **40,000 Rwf**, and our goal is to raise a total of **1,600,000 Rwf** for one term to ensure that no child drops out of school.

## Project Structure

The project is built using **Next.js** and includes a responsive layout designed to encourage donations through a friendly and engaging user interface.

### Key Features

- **Progress Tracker**: Displays the total amount raised and the goal amount.
- **Donation Options**: Users can contribute any amount starting from **100 Rwf**.
